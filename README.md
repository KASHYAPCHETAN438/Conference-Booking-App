Like we use these approach 
==========================

Database: Stores rooms, users, and bookings (MySQL).

    üìä Database Tables
        user: stores users, roles
        room: stores conference room info
        time_slot: all 30-minute intervals, is_booked flag
        booking: stores booking date, confirmation code, room/user mapping
        booking_time_slot: join table between booking and time_slot


    üîÆ Future Improvements
        Admin dashboard UI
        Room filtering (by type, capacity)
        Weekly view calendar for bookings
        Recurring meeting support
